Anybody can contribute to the Akamai DevOps library by just sharing 3 files into a github subrepo under https://github.com/akamai/akamai-devops-library.git: 

* A screenshot(s) showing how to implement the functionality using the Graphical User Interface in the Akamai Console https://control.akamai.com
* A JSON file showing the code people need to use to implement the functionality by using a Command Line Interface client like [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) or the [Akamai CLI](https://developer.akamai.com/cli/)
* A readme text file explaining how to implement the functionality using the UI (referencing the screenshot) or through the API (referencing the json file). See [(see sample README.md)](./sample_README.md)
